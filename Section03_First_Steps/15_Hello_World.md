Open Terminal, switch to jshell using the command "jshell".

Then print Hello World! using
System.out.println("Hello World!")

It is a statement. A statement is basically a complete command to be executed, it can include one or more expressions. A statement can be a print statement, a variable declaration, a loop, a conditional statement.

Double quote and single quote works similarly in Python and JS, but in Java, these are two different things. Double quotes used for string literals. Single quotes used for character literals such as 'a'.

cntrl + d or /ex or /exit to exit jshell.
