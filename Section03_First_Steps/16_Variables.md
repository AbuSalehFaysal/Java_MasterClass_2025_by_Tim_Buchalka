VARIABLES
Variables are used to store values. Variables are named and can be used to store any type of data.

DECLARATION STATEMENT
used to define a variable by indicating the data type.
int myFirstVariable = 5;

EXPRESSIONS
coding construct that evaluates a single value.

int myFirstVariable = 5; // declares 5
System.out.println(myFirstVariable); // prints 5
int myFirstVariable = 10; // declares 10
System.out.println(myFirstVariable); // Now the same variable will prints 10

jshell will allow it, but in java compiler, an already declared variable cannot be redeclared.

int sum = 5 + 10;
System.out.println(sum); // print 15, java calculates if it's a mathematical expression.
