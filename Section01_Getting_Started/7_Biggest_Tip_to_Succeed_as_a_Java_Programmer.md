- Unconscious Incompetence: It's hard to make decisions when you just started about what to learn or what not to learn. You are confused about choosing a tech stack. You don't know what you don't know.

- Conscious Incompetence: You acknowledge that what you want to be and what you need to learn. You are aware of your limitations. You know what you don't know.

- Conscious Competence: You have learned some of the stuff, but you are constantly worrying about consuming all the skills that you are acquiring and you know your strengths and weaknesses.

- Unconscious Competence: You have mastered the skills, and you can do them without thinking. But this not not the end, when you pick up another at this point, there would still be some frustrations but it would be easier to deal because you've gone through this previously.
